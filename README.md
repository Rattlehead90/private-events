# Goal
This is a test app created as tasked by The Odin Project (find at 
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-private-events)
to practice Active Record many-to-many through associations. 

# Gist
This app allows users to create an account and events they wish to 
keep track of. The events are shared with the community of users who 
can choose to attend any published event. Attended events are displayed
in their home page.
